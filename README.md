<h1 align="center">Beginner Exploring Arch Linux</h1>

### Getting Started
 This will be a collection of installation guides, notes and troubleshooting I've used whilst exploring and getting into Linux and more specifically Arch. I'm a rookie when it comes to Linux so this is isn't a fully comprehensive guide and I'm sure their will be mistakes along the way.
